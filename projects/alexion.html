                    <p class="section-intro " style="text-align:center">Our team worked with Open Payments, a national disclosure program created by the Affordable Care Act and managed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The dataset shows the financial relationships between pharmaceutical
                        companies and medical device industries, and physicians and teaching hospitals.
                        <br><br>Applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations (GPOs) must submit their payments information to the program, which then categorizes these payments into three categories:
                        <br><br>&#8226; General payments: payments that are not connected with research purposes.
                        <br><br>&#8226; Research payments: payments that are made in connection with a research agreement or protocol.
                        <br><br>&#8226; Physician ownership or investment interest information: ownership or investment interest a physician owns to an applicable manufacturer or GPO.
                        <br><br>Our team decided to <span class="highlight">focus on general payments and research payments</span> for our analysis.

                        I also studied secondary sources such as newspaper, research articles and journals to dive deeper into why royalties exists as well as recommend strategies for Alexion to offset the negative impact.

                    <p class="section-intro ">Having competed the previous year but only won 2nd prize of the Visualization track, I was determined to place in the Analytics track this time. Therefore, not only that we spent more time messing around with data, but also on structuring
                        the analysis into a story that engaged the audience, those who were not familiar with the dataset. As my partners and I all came from non-English speaking countries, we sometimes cannot help but keep rambling on when we want to
                        convey an idea; thus, structuring did helped us a lot on clear, concise, and persuasive communication.
                        <br><br>From a personal development standpoint, unlike other case competitions I have been through, this was my first time leading a team of introverts who had no connection with each other prior to the competition. As an introvert
                        myself, I first struggled with starting conversations and created an environment which everyone felt comfortable. Therefore, I decided to take another approach: talking to each person individually and organizing team lunches for
                        the team to bond outside of meetings. Doing so allowed the team dynamics to increase, contributing to us collaborating well and winning.
