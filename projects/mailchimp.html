                        nurturing</span>, as automated emails receive 152% higher open rates than non-automated ones.
                        <br><br>To help marketers better manage their automated campaigns, companies within the industry offer <span class="highlight">visual workflow builder</span>. This is a graphical user interface with which marketers can create workflows

                    <p class="section-intro ">Another area I think MailChimp should consider is to <span class="highlight">incorporate propensity modelling</span> into its analytics capabilities. Propensity modeling is one of the most important predictive analytics technique,
                        along with cluster modeling (segmentation) and collaborative filtering (recommendation). It is used to anticipate the future behaviors of customers based on past behaviors. There are four main types of propensity modeling: propensity
                        to engage, propensity to churn, propensity to purchase, and propensity to unsubscribe.
                        <br><br>Based on research, 23% of marketers said that they employ some forms of predictive analysis in their marketing strategy, while 32% wish to implement within the next five years. That being said, marketers <span class="highlight">care</span>                        about what actions their customers would take in the future. The rise of big data has create numerous opportunities to understand customers, but at the same time security regulations arise, making future data less accessible. Therefore,
                        <span class="highlight">marketers must learn to leverage past and current data</span> to craft successful strategy.

                        by <span class="highlight">building an in-house capability</span> to predict churn/unsubscription, or allowing more <span class="highlight">integration options with churn analytics platforms</span> such as Dataiku. As none of other
