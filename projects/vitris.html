                        my cover letter and portfolio to Jack Perrotta, founder of Vitris. The journey turned out to be more than what I expected: although filled with ups and downs, startup life definitely shaped me as a person today.

                    <p class="section-intro">Situated at MakeOffices co-working space in the heart of Philadelphia, Vitris is a digital marketing agency specialized in websites, online paid advertising and content creation. Started as a phone repair entrepreneurship venture from
                        Temple University, Vitris has grown into a company which utilized artificial intelligence to help small business owners succeed in the online world.
                        <br><br>One of the factor that helps Vitris differentiate itself is its in-house content management system, called the Vitris platform. Like Wordpress and Wix, this system allows Vitris to build customized websites for customers,
                        but at the same time, integrate appointment booking, online payments, analytics reporting and local search.

                    <p class="section-intro " style="text-align:right ">Two hours into my first day, I had my first project: validating the use of code variables across the platform. At that time, the team has no standard way to document the codebase, which resulted in variables misused and bugs unable
                        to trace. Jack thought that giving me this task will help me onboard more easily.
                        <br><br>Indeed, over the next days, my Chrome tabs blew up. I spent hours familiarizing myself with TypeScript and Angular.js. I also printed out over 100 pages of code and used my highlighter to map variables and figured out how
                        they were used. I would not say that I liked this project; however, it definitely allowed me to know the ins and outs of the platform.
                        <br><br>My deliverable, a source-code documentation, ended up help the team reduce duplication, errors and redundancy by 15%. It was a good start. I was ready for the next steps.

                        in color mixing, used Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator to create customized components, and most importantly, learned how the web renderer portion of Vitris platform works.
                        <br><br>Being in the shoes of designers who used the platform daily, I realized that the whole process of creating a website was super lengthy. It was due to the fact that the platform prompts designers to reupload every time they
                        want to reuse an image.
                        <br><br>I wondered if <span class="highlight">there was a better way to manage media files so that the whole process could be expedited</span>?

                    <p class="section-intro" style="text-align:center">In addition to the analysis, I compiled a pitch deck detailing the needs for and the impact of having a centralized media library and presented to the team. There were questions about whether or not this was an immediate need, as designers
                        "were skilled with Vitris to an extend that they didn't need aditional help". However, I argued that not only the feature would help designers save time for other things, but also benefit customers since Vitris wanted to hand over
                        the web design process to them in the long-run. Higher customer satisfaction and increased competitive advantage.
                        <br><br>My proposal got approved. A project to build the feature was created, and I went on to the prototyping phase.</p>
