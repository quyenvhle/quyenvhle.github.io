                    <p class="section-intro">Situated at MakeOffices co-working space in the heart of Philadelphia, Vitris is a digital marketing agency specialized in websites, online paid advertising and content creation. Started as a phone repair entrepreneurship venture from
                        Temple University, Vitris has grown into a company which utilized artificial intelligence to help small business owners succeed in the online world.
                        <br><br>One of the factor that helps Vitris differentiate itself is its in-house content management system, called the Vitris platform. Like Wordpress and Wix, this system allows Vitris to build customized websites for customers,
                        but at the same time, integrate appointment booking, online payments, analytics reporting and local search.

                    <p class="section-intro ">Two hours into my first day, I had my first project: validating the use of code variables across the platform. At that time, the team has no standard way to document the codebase, which resulted in variables misused and bugs unable
                        to trace. Jack thought that giving me this task will help me onboard more easily.
                        <br><br>Indeed, over the next days, my Chrome tabs blew up. I spent hours familiarizing myself with TypeScript and Angular.js. I also printed out over 100 pages of code and used my highlighter to map variables and figured out how
                        they were used. I would not say that I liked this project; however, it definitely allowed me to know the ins and outs of the platform.
                        <br><br>My deliverable, a source-code documentation, ended up helping the team reduce duplication, errors and redundancy. It was a good start. I was ready for the next steps.

                    <p class="section-intro ">The following week, I rotated to the Design team and undertook three web design projects, for real customers. I shadowed the Lead Designer, hopped on phone calls with customers to understand the brand, researched the best practices
                        in color mixing, used Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator to create customized components, and most importantly, learned how the web renderer portion of Vitris platform works.
                        <br><br>Being in the shoes of designers who used the platform daily, I realized that the whole process of creating a website was super lengthy. It was due to the fact that the platform prompts designers to reupload every time they
                        want to reuse an image. Curious, I observed other designers in the company and noticed that this is a common struggle.
                        <br><br>I wondered if <span class="highlight">there was a better way to manage media files so that the whole process could be expedited</span>?

                        I argued that not only the feature would <span class="highlight">help designers save time for other things</span>, but also <span class="highlight">benefit customers since Vitris wanted to hand over the web design process to them in the long-run</span>.
                        Higher customer satisfaction and increased competitive advantage.

                    <p class="section-intro ">My five months with Vitris was valuable. As I've always been a person that prefers structure and clear layers, I learned to twerk the old working style to embrace the uncertainties. In a startup, people do things outside of their realms:
                        a designer can code and a developer must learn to design; thus, this experience has helped me become more versatile and developed a growth mindset of always keep exploring.
                        <br><br>Startup life is also not very easy. There's always a battle between releasing products to get customers as early as possible (immediate success), and taking longer time to ensure that the right products are out there (sustainable
                        success). There's pressure to break new ground, but there's also pressure to not discourage employees. Either way, it's necessary to self-cultivate an energy that keeps you rolling up your sleeves and getting your hands dirty.
                        In the end, it will pay off eventually.
