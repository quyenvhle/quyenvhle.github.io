                        strategies, have to go through back-and-forth communication with the system admin to get what they want. This results in a waste of approximately 60 working hours per month that can be used for something else.</p>

                        what pain points these stakeholders were facing and was able to identify the project scope. I also analyzed how different data sources were connected together and was able to produce an integrated process flow and a database architecture

                    <p class="section-intro ">Beyond the dashboard, I also took the time to perform some exploratory analysis to better understand attendee engagement during the conference. This allowed me to come up with six uncovered metrics and pitched these to a team in charged
                        of building an internal marketing intelligence tool. Although the team loved the metrics, they weren't able comprehensively paint the big picture of how Autodesk customers and business partners interact with different marketing
                        and sales channels since they only reflect what's coming from the Events side. <br><br>As I will come back as a Data Analytics Intern for the fall semester, I hope to further look at engagement data pre- and post-conference, as
                        well as additional data from Sales and Marketing, to refine these metrics and potentially implement a machine learning model to measure engagement.</p>

                    <p class="section-intro ">Overall, the internship was a spectacular experience for me. I challenged myself with learning Python on the spot, volunteered with Girls Who Code, engaged in talks with product managers and data scientists around the Bay, tried laser
                        cutting for the first time, and of course, slurped copious amount of Philz coffee which was the-best-thing-ever. <br><br> Two critical lessons I learned: <br>&#8226; <span class="highlight">Work independently but collaboratively</span>:
                        With full ownership of this project, I managed my own timeline and deliverables, but at the same time, needed to stay communicative with stakeholders to ensure they know about the dashboard and its impact.<br> &#8226; <span class="highlight">Stay proactive</span>:
                        As the only technical person within my team, there were times that I got stuck with a piece of code or didn't know if my analysis was right. Thus, I had to actively meet with data analysts and engineers from other departments and
                        asked them questions to help me move forward.</p>
