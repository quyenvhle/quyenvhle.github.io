                        and won <span class="highlight">1st place</span> out of 15 teams. The full slides deck can be found here.

                    <p class="section-intro">With $25.5 billion in planned spending in 2018, the Back-to-College season is considered one of the biggest shopping season of the year. Key players in the industry, such as Walmart, IKEA, Amazon, are using innovative ways to drive
                        sales, foot traffic and great guest experiences. The increase in competition from both brick-and-mortar and online retailers poses a question to Target: <span class="highlight">How can the company differentiate itself and
                        achieve results throughout stores that vary in physical size, volume, location and complexity?</span>

                    <p class="section-intro " style="text-align:right ">As a retailer, Target does a great job with engaging college students through shopping parties and college stylists on Youtube. However, compared to its competitors, Target's e-commerce capabilities is underutilized, and there exists
                        an untapped opportunity to engage with parents, the ones with high purchasing power.

                        shoppers to lifetime loyal guests. With that in mind, we came up with <span class="highlight">CollegeUp, a three-stage plan that blends together emotional storytelling and digital innovations</span>.</p>

                    <p class="section-intro ">With 50% of BTC shopping took place before the school year starts, it is important for Target to capture guests' attention early. In “Raising Awareness", Target can build and maintain a strong online and offline presence by investing
                        in paid partnership and promotional contents. For the first part, paid partnership, we suggest Target to partner with micro-influencers whose main contents focus on lifestyle, beauty, decorations, DIYs.
                        <br><br>Target should also focus on running ads through online and offline channels, traditional and modern channels to drive higher traffic to its website and physical stores. In addition, based on the data collected from these
                        platforms, Target can personalize ads and present more relevant recommendations to prospective guests, encouraging more purchases to be made.

                    <p class="section-intro " style="text-align:right ">With guests knowing about the campaign, Target can convert them into participants through phase 2. Since part of Target’s core guests are millennials with interests in technology trends, we propose the implementation of Virtual Rooms
                        at 3 biggest Target stores. Through using a VR headset, guest can design their dream rooms with Target’s catalog of household items, furniture, and decorations and actually see how the designs will turn out.
                        <br><br>In addition, Target can partner with local university to hold workshops during move in week. As going into college is a big milestone, participating in the workshops promise to bring students and parent good memories and
                        quality time together before school begins. Moreover, bringing products to these workshops and letting participants try them out will also help Target drive sales of these featured items.</p>

                    <p class="section-intro " style="text-align:center ">While the Back-to-college hype only lasts from July to September, the bond between parents and their children extends beyond the season. Therefore, we suggest that Target expand the existing subscription model to include monthly care
                        packages - parcels of products that parents can customize and send to their children. With 60% of parents wish to spread out their budget, care packages serve as an efficient way for these guests to allocate spending throughout
                        the year, while nurturing the relationships with their children. The new offering also allows Target to promote the use of REDCards, which give discounts on subscription-based items, and thus, pose an opportunity to convert these
                        parents into lifelong guests. </p>

                        phase; however, I'm still grateful for the opportunity to help the retailer develop a marketing plan from the perspective of a student, Back-to-College season's main audience. </p>
